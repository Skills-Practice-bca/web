                According to Britannica, "The United Nations declared Gandhi's birthday, October 2nd, as the International Day of Non-violence in 2007." <br>
                <br>
                While the world knows him as Mahatma Gandhi, a beacon of nonviolent resistance and Indian independence, his journey began with a more humble name: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Born in 1869, Mohandas' life took a pivotal turn when he encountered the title that would forever shape his legacy: Mahatma.<br>
                <br>
                In 1883, at the tender age of 13, Mohandas Gandhi's life took a significant turn when he was arranged to marry Kasturba Makhanji, who was also 13 at the time.<br>
                <br>
                In 1930, the world watched with bated breath as India's independence movement gained momentum under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. His unwavering commitment to nonviolent resistance, his charisma, and his ability to mobilise millions made him the Person of the Year by the Time Magazine. 
                A lifelong vegetarian, Mr. Gandhi's meals centered on fresh vegetables, curd, fruits, seeds, and nuts.
